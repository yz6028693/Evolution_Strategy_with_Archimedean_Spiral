The main goal of this demo is to apply Evolution Strategy algorithm to create points (red points) to find location of each random point (blue point) created from Archimedean Spiral curve.

The details of this demo can be accessed here: <a href = 'Evolution Strategy Algorithm and You.pdf'>Link</a>

Python package needed: 1. Numpy; 2. Matplotlib

<div style="overflow:hidden; width:98%;">
<div style="float: left; width: 48%;">

Old version without grouping:


<a><img src="Gif&Images/ES_FirstVersion.gif" width = 50% position = 'ralative'></a>
</div>

<div style="float: left; width: 48%;">

New algorithm with separate group and parallel computing：


<a><img src="Gif&Images/ES_WithGroup.gif" width = 50% position = 'ralative'></a>
</div>

I consider each blue point as a planet, as a result, the environment of this demo look like this (Rescaled gravitational field in this 2-D space):


<a><img src="Gif&Images/Environment.png" width = 50% position = 'ralative'></a>

</div>
